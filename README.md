# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

_This component is no longer maintained._ The code remains available for reference purposes only. I recommend using
the core `soma` integration instead.

## SOMA Connect for Home Assistant

This custom component was intended to be used instead of the core `soma` integration.
It used more resilient methods of communicating with the SOMA Connect device and
provided additional entities including battery and light levels.
