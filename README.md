# SOMA Connect for Home Assistant

This custom component is intended to be used instead of the core `soma` integration.
It uses more resilient methods of communicating with the SOMA Connect device and
provides additional entities including battery and light levels.

## Installation

Add <https://github.com/Djelibeybi/hass-soma-connect> to [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) as
[a new repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/navigation/stores) in the _Integration_
category. After a few moments, it should appear as a "New Repository" to be
installed.
